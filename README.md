# Optimization

This Repository contains work done in Optimization and a project on Statistical Estimation.

* The goal of this python file is to manipulate some of the convex optimization tools from scipy.optimize, which you is needed to implement the machine learning algorithms. 


This Repository also contains a project work on Statistical Estimation.

# Summary of Project on  Statistical Estimation

* The goal of the project is:
 Leveraging statistical and optimisation principles to design the
optimal strategy to adopt in the light of real world problems with numerous alternative solutions.


# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We  implemented  PCA. 

* Assume that we are performing PCA on some dataset $$\boldsymbol X$$ for $$M$$ principal components. 
We then need to perform the following steps, which we break into parts:

   1. Data normalization (`normalize`).
   2. Find eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for the covariance matrix $$S$$.
   Sort by the largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors (`eig`).

* After these steps, we can then compute the projection and reconstruction of the data onto the spaced spanned by the top $$n$$ eigenvectors.


# Optimisation Algorithms For Neural Network

This repository also contains work done in Optimisation Algorithms For Neural Network.

* Some of the optimizers discussed are :
