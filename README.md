# Summary of Project on  Statistical Estimation

This Repository contains a Project work on Statistical Estimation.

* The goal of the Project is:

Leveraging statistical and optimisation principles to design the
optimal strategy to adopt in the light of real world problems with numerous alternative solutions.

In this project we discussed:

* Maximum Likelihood Esstimation (MLE)

* Hypothesis Testing 

*  Probability Matrix

* Randomize Detector 

* Minimax Detector Design 

* Experiment Design



* Scalarization 
   
   * A-Optimal Design
   
   * E-Optimal Design
   
   * D-Optimal Design
   
   
  
 
# Optimization

This Repository contains work done on some optimization techniques in Machine Learning.

 

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We  implemented  PCA. 

* Assume that we are performing PCA on some dataset **X** for **M** principal components. 

We then need to perform the following steps, which we break into parts:

   1. Data normalization (`normalize`).
   2. Find eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors for the covariance matrix **S**.
   Sort by the largest eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors (`eig`).

* After these steps, we can then compute the projection and reconstruction of the data onto the spaced spanned **n**  eigenvectors.




# Optimisation Algorithms For Neural Network

This repository also contains a research on Optimisation Algorithms For Neural Network.

* Some of the optimizers discussed are :

    * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Momentum
    
    * AdaGrad
    
    * RMSProp (Root Mean Square)
    
    * Adam Optimizer
