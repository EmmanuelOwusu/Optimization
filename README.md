# Optimization

This Repository contains work done in Optimization and a project on Statistical Estimation.

* The goal of this python file is to manipulate some of the convex optimisation tools from scipy.optimize, which you is needed to implement the machine learning algorithms. 


This Repository also contains a project work on Statistical Estimation.

# Summary of Project on  Statistical Estimation

* The goal of the project is:
 Leveraging statistical and optimisation principles to design the
optimal strategy to adopt in the light of real world problems with numerous alternative solutions.



# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
